# Parag√≥ne Signature and Associates website ui

# React + TypeScript + Vite

# Few things to NOTE to ensure continuity:
Folder structure:

- Folders are structured based on App features or/and pages.

- Top level folder for page or feature
    - /components
    - /hooks
    - /reducers
    - /selectors
    - /helpers <!-- for helper functions per feature or page -->
    - /types
    - /__data__  <!-- if needed -->
    - /__fixtures__  <!-- if needed -->
  
- We don't use css files, all styling is done via the sx prop in MUI components find example in App.tsx.

- Api calls are made inside hooks and dispatched to the store(if needed) through a reducer.

- Do NOT push to the `main/master` branch rather create a new branch `git checkout -b <new-branch>`.

- Do a pull/merge request into the `main/master` branch that'd be approved by the lead

# CLEANUP:
1.    Base url should be put in an environment variable so it's easily accessible and can be changed easily from the deployment server.
2.    Delete all commented codes. (comments for documentation can be left, but we don't want commented codes in the main branch)
3.    Remove all the previous temporary data that was used before enpoints were made.
